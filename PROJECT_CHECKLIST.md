# Project Checklist: Databricks Job Automation Agent

## 1. Project Setup & Environment
- [x] Review and finalize all requirements from the PRD.
- [x] Set up Databricks workspace and configure credentials.
- [x] Initialize the state database with proper transactional support.
- [x] Configure local environment for managing markdown documentation.

## 2. System Architecture & Design
- [ ] Create/update a high-level architecture diagram illustrating:
  - Tech Lead and Worker components.
  - Integration with Retriever, Databricks Python SDK, Markdown Manager, and State Database.
  - Unity Catalog and Langchain integrations.
- [ ] Define data flow between components.
- [ ] Validate non-functional requirements (performance, reliability, scalability, and security).

## 3. Multi-Persona Architecture Implementation
### Tech Lead Component
- [ ] Implement job requirement interpretation.
- [ ] Integrate the retriever tool for fetching relevant documentation.
- [ ] Design and implement the task assignment process to the Worker.

### Worker Component
- [ ] **Validate Phase:** Ensure task prerequisites and state verification.
- [ ] **Plan Phase:** Generate a detailed, actionable sequence of steps.
- [ ] **Apply Phase:** 
  - Integrate with the Databricks Python SDK for executing tasks.
  - Update the state database according to task progress.

## 4. Tool Integrations
- [ ] **Retriever:**
  - Implement keyword-based documentation retrieval.
  - Validate relevance of retrieved content.
- [ ] **Databricks Python SDK:**
  - Integrate for all required Databricks operations.
  - Implement error handling and logging for SDK interactions.
- [ ] **Local Markdown Files:**
  - Enable read/write operations to track task progress.
  - Maintain audit trails in markdown files.
- [ ] **State Database:**
  - Ensure consistent recording and querying of task states.
- [ ] **Unity Catalog Integration:**
  - Integrate UnitycatalogFunctionClient for UC functions.
  - Provide configuration for Databricks-managed Unity Catalog setups (using DatabricksFunctionClient).
  - Expose UC functions as native Langchain tools via the UCFunctionToolkit.
  - Implement robust error handling, logging, and security for function definitions.
  - **Reference:** [Unity Catalog Integration with Langchain](https://github.com/unitycatalog/unitycatalog/tree/main/ai/integrations/langchain)

## 5. Workflow Execution
- [ ] **Validation:**  
  - Confirm prerequisites and correct task state before workflow execution.
- [ ] **Planning:**  
  - Break down tasks into a detailed list of actionable steps.
- [ ] **Application:**  
  - Execute planned steps and update task state accordingly.

## 6. Error Handling & Logging
- [ ] Implement error handling across all phases (validation, planning, application).
- [ ] Log critical events, decisions, and state changes to support troubleshooting and auditing.

## 7. GenAI Agent Evaluation & Feedback Using Custom Metrics
- [ ] **Custom Metrics Framework:**
  - Develop a custom metrics system using Python decorators (e.g., `@metric`).
  - Integrate with MLflow's evaluation method to include custom metrics via the `extra_metrics` field.
- [ ] **Custom Metrics Requirements:**
  - Allow returning pass/fail (e.g., "yes"/"no"), numeric (int/float), or boolean values.
  - Provide access to full evaluation data (input req., expected outputs, retrieved context, execution traces).
  - Enable custom additional fields (e.g., `custom_expected`) for metric computation.
  - Integrate custom metrics with dashboards, logs, and automated alerts.
  - **Reference:** [Custom Metrics Documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/en/generative-ai/agent-evaluation/custom-metrics.html)
- [ ] **User Feedback Incorporation:**
  - Establish mechanisms to capture end-user feedback through Databricks-supported interfaces.
  - Combine feedback with custom metrics to iteratively improve agent performance.
- [ ] **Continuous Monitoring & Iterative Improvement:**
  - Set up dashboards and logging integrations (e.g., via MLflow) for real-time monitoring.
  - Implement automated alerts for performance degradations.
  - Define review cycles for performance metrics and feedback incorporation.

## 8. Use Case Implementation
- [ ] **Create Job Use Case:**
  - Implement the complete flow from job requirement intake to job creation.
  - Validate through comprehensive testing scenarios.
- [ ] **Update Job Use Case:**
  - Implement update modifications and re-execution of the validate-plan-apply workflow.
  - Ensure accurate state tracking and documentation.

## 9. Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Conduct integration testing for all components.
- [ ] Perform user acceptance testing (UAT) based on the defined use cases.
- [ ] Finalize and update user and developer documentation.
- [ ] Deploy the solution to the production environment and monitor feedback.

## 10. Future Enhancements
- [ ] Expand functionality to support additional Databricks operations.
- [ ] Explore advanced AI features for real-time task prioritization and dynamic workflow adjustments.
- [ ] Investigate collaboration features for multi-user environments.

## 11. Miscellaneous Tasks
- [ ] Perform code reviews and quality assurance checks.
- [ ] Optimize performance (latency, throughput).
- [ ] Ensure robust security for credentials and sensitive configurations.
